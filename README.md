# KONWERTER

Konwerter_1.c is a newer one with the intent to be more readable and easier to fix.

I know i can change numeric systems easily with other libraries, but this is a training for me.

Oh yeah and i don't know polish but i love it, im trying to fix it on my head by using it's translation but i'm having a hard time and may look like an absolute idiot, you can ignore the strange names :').

## Done

- main function numeric system caller
- input reader for char/int arrays with dynamic memory allocation 
- dec <=> bin <=> oct konwertery
- terminal printers

## To do

- Finish hexadecimal konwertery
- Mix the binary and octal konwertery (they have basically the same code with a single integer value difference)
- Set the program so it can work in other repositories, along with it's mathematical functions

    current mathematical functions:

    - podniesc
    - korzen (blank)
    - lg 

- Give the capability of returning other types on values to Konwerter, like single integers instead of an array of integers

- And finally remove the comments from the code and actually pull off some effort to make a decent README explaining what each function does.
