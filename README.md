# KONWERTER

This is just me learning about c, and i'm going to redo it quite alot of times to test other kinds of stuff, mainly when i stop learning about Bash, python and other languages, this is just for people who might see this ( i mean none/1 dude ) and think i'm inactive due to git frequency (iM noT'111!!111!).

Konwerter is just a really inefficient binary/hexadecimal/octal/decimal converter (which actually works1111111!!!!!!1!, im happy.) with useless dynamic memory allocation (i mean who the actual **** would spend their time making dynamic memory allocation in a program that consumes no RAM?!?!!?) which i only applied because i thought it was super cool (still is). Someone has asked me already and i got angry; no i didnt ****ing take the functions off sites, i've only gone through stack overflow to check how pointers and keyboard reading worked kekw..... (jeki's mad), and yeah i'm sort of a clown, good humoured type B'), and it feels strange writing this when no one's gonna read hehhe.
