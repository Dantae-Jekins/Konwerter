Before anything: i've never taken english classes, and i'm open to critics, things may look wonky when reading.

## Purpose, uses & objectives

There's no pratical use to this currently, it's more of a "pipe" to motivate myself in learning about C ( i really like to work out in my foundations like programming logic before moving on to more complex stuff ) alone, currently it doesn't do anything other common libraries wouldn't be able to and *probably* in a less efficient way. One of the main objectives was to use as little libraries as i could, and set my own methods (functions) when needed, i'd guess that would be a huge waste of time in a professional occasion but i do consider it something good when it comes to learning. (hope i'm right, there's also the possibility that there are better things to pour time in than this)

This has also been of great help for me to get used to code editors like VIM ( I **had** no idea why people loved it so much, kinda do now, i'm not a huge fan of using the mouse to navigate) after i've installed Linux. So yeah it's more of a train than a applicable program.

I've stated that there's *"no pratical use to this currently"*, so i am implying that i plan to work it out to the point it becomes somewhat useful, maybe some sort of encoding based on the same idea numeric systems have.
